## Abstract

A semi-automated micro solid-phase extraction (μSPE) method has been
developed and optimized for the quantification of 21 per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) across various biological matrices,
including plasma, serum, urine, and liver tissue. This method employed
μSPE cartridges integrated with a PAL-RTC robotic system, which enabled
precise flow control and high-throughput procedures while ensuring
exceptional extraction efficiency and reproducibility. Sample
homogenization of liver tissues was achieved by bead-mill technology
which eliminated sample cross-contamination and significantly reduced
processing time. The extraction efficiency was influenced by the
concentration of methanol in the sample, especially for longer-chain
PFAS (C9–14). Extraction efficiencies of over 90% extraction were
achieved with loading solutions containing 50–60% methanol in plasma and
serum, and up to 80% methanol in water samples. The μSPE protocol
included two sequential wash steps that provided excellent matrix
clean-up, and reduced background signals by over 95% compared to
traditional protein precipitation (PP) methods. The µSPE-LC-MS/MS method
offers high sensitivity (method detection limits between 0.008 ng/mL and
0.048 ng/mL), along with good recoveries (90.3 to 105.1%), and precision
(RSD \<10%). It also demonstrated strong agreement with non-certified
values of NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRM 1957/1958). The method
was successfully used in the analysis of PFAS in human urine and plasma,
as well as in mouse liver samples from an in vivo study. The μSPE
approach provides a sensitive, reproducible, and automated solution that
requires limited biological sample volumes, making it suitable for the
analysis of PFAS in biomonitoring and toxicokinetic studies.
